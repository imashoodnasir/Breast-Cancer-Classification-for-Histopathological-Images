<h1>Breast Cancer Classification for Histopathological Images</h1>
<p>Breast cancer is considered as the most perilous sickness among females worldwide and the ratio of new cases is expanding yearly. Many researchers have proposed efficient algorithms to diagnose breast cancer at early stages, which have increased the efficiency and performance by utilizing the learned features of gold standard histopathological images</p>
<p>A hybrid approach is proposed by fusing and optimizing the properties of handcrafted and deep features to classify the breast cancer images. HOG and LBP features are serially fused with pretrained models VGG19 and InceptionV3. PCR and ICR are used to evaluate the classification performance of proposed method.</p>
<p>The method concentrates on histopathological images to classify the breast cancer. The performance is compared with state-of-the-art techniques, where an overall patient-level accuracy of 97.2% and image-level accuracy of 96.7% is recorded.</p>
