# Breast-Cancer-Classification-for-Histopathological-Images
A hybrid approach is proposed by fusing and optimizing the properties of handcrafted and deep features to classify the breast cancer images. HOG and LBP features are serially fused with pre-trained models VGG19 and InceptionV3. PCR and ICR are used to evaluate the classification performance of the proposed method.
